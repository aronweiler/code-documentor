# Documentation for install.sh

# install.sh

## Purpose

The `install.sh` script automates the setup process for the Documentation Pipeline project on Mac and Linux systems. It creates and configures a Python virtual environment, installs required dependencies, and prepares local environment configuration files. This ensures that contributors and users can reliably initialize a consistent development or execution environment for the project.

---

## Functionality

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Check Python 3 Availability**  
   Verifies that Python 3 is installed on the system. Exits with a message if not found.

2. **Display Python Version**  
   Outputs the detected Python version.

3. **Virtual Environment Management**
   - If the script is run inside an existing virtual environment, it uses that environment.
   - Otherwise, it creates a new virtual environment in a subdirectory named `venv`.
   - Checks for successful creation.

4. **Upgrade Pip**  
   Ensures the latest version of `pip` is installed within the virtual environment.

5. **Install Python Dependencies**  
   Installs all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip`, if the file is present.

6. **Setup Environment Configuration**  
   - Checks for a `.env` file.
   - If not found, copies `.env.example` to `.env` (if available).
   - Instructs user to edit `.env` for required secrets and keys.

7. **Completion Instructions**  
   Provides next-step instructions: activating the virtual environment, running configuration validation, analyzing repositories, generating documentation, and accessing help.

## Key Components

### Variables

- `venv_python`  
  Path to the Python interpreter in the virtual environment.

- `venv_pip`  
  Path to `pip` in the virtual environment.

- `python_version`  
  The system's current Python 3 version string.

### Main Script Actions

- **Check for Python 3:**  
  Uses `command -v python3` to test availability.
- **Virtual Environment Detection:**  
  Uses the `$VIRTUAL_ENV` variable to check if already inside a virtualenv.
- **Virtual Environment Creation:**  
  Executes `python3 -m venv venv` if not already in a venv.
- **Dependency Installation:**  
  Installs from `requirements.txt` if it exists.
- **Environment File Setup:**  
  Handles creation/copying of the `.env` config file.

---

## Dependencies

### Required Before Running

- **Python 3**  
  Must be installed and available in the system path.

- **requirements.txt** (optional but recommended)  
  Should contain all Python dependencies needed for the project.

- **.env.example** (optional)  
  Template for environment variables.

### Produced and Required by the Project

- **venv/**  
  The local Python virtual environment used for project isolation.

- **.env**  
  Environment configuration file, potentially containing API keys and secrets, used by the Python application (typically read via packages like `python-dotenv`).

- **requirements.txt**  
  Installed by this script; maintained by project developers.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```sh
# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x install.sh

# Run the setup script
./install.sh
```

### Typical Workflow After Installation

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   ```sh
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Edit Environment Variables:**
   - Open `.env` and add required keys/secrets.

3. **Validate Configuration:**
   ```sh
   ./venv/bin/python main.py validate-config
   ```

4. **Analyze a Repository:**
   ```sh
   ./venv/bin/python main.py analyze /path/to/repo
   ```

5. **Generate Documentation:**
   ```sh
   ./venv/bin/python main.py --repo-path /path/to/repo
   ```

6. **For Help:**
   ```sh
   ./venv/bin/python main.py --help
   ```

## Notes

- **Platform Support:**  
  Written for Mac and Linux platforms; not expected to work on Windows without modification.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Uses `set -e` to exit on any encountered error, ensuring a consistent environment.

- **Customization:**  
  You may need to modify or create `.env` according to your project's requirements.

---

## Summary

`install.sh` streamlines the setup and dependency management for the Documentation Pipeline project, reducing manual error and ensuring developers and users are quickly up and running with a standardized Python environment.
