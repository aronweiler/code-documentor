# Documentation for .vscode/settings.json

# .vscode/settings.json

## Purpose

This file configures user and workspace-specific settings for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) within this particular project. It ensures VS Code uses the correct Python interpreter and provides configurations for launching a custom documentation server ("mcp.servers"). The file aims to streamline development and tool integration by automating environment selection and custom command execution.

---

## Functionality

### 1. Python Interpreter Path

- **python.pythonPath**
- **python.defaultInterpreterPath**

Both settings specify the path to the Python interpreter the project should use. By pointing to the virtual environment inside the project folder (`${workspaceFolder}/venv/Scripts/python.exe`), VS Code and its extensions (such as the Python extension) will utilize the isolated virtual environment for linting, debugging, running, and other Python activities.

### 2. MCP Server Configuration

- **mcp.servers**  
Defines a custom command for launching a documentation server:
  - **documentation-server**
    - **command**: The executable to run (Python from the virtual environment).
    - **args**: Arguments for the command; runs a script (`mcp_server.py`) with the workspace folder as an argument.
    - **cwd**: Sets the current working directory for the server process to the workspace root.

---

## Key Components

- **Python Interpreter Path Settings**  
  Ensures all Python tooling in VS Code uses the local virtual environment.

- **mcp.servers Object**
  - **documentation-server**: A named server configuration for managing and running project documentation-related processes.

- **Path Variables**
  - `${workspaceFolder}`: Dynamic VS Code variable referencing the root of the opened project/workspace.

---

## Dependencies

### Requirements

- A virtual environment located at `./venv/`, created with Python, containing all necessary dependencies.
- The `mcp_server.py` Python script present in the root of the workspace.
- Visual Studio Code, with (optionally) the Python extension and other extensions that consume these settings.

### Dependent Systems

- Other developers opening this workspace in VS Code will automatically pick up these settings for a consistent environment.
- Extensions or tasks that use these configuration fields directly, such as those integrating custom servers (may require additional MCP / multipurpose extension support).

---

## Usage Examples

### 1. Using the Python Interpreter

When opening the project in VS Code, it will automatically use Python from:
```
${workspaceFolder}/venv/Scripts/python.exe
```
for all Python-related tasks (linting, running scripts, debugging, etc.).

### 2. Running the Documentation Server

If your VS Code setup or a custom extension supports `mcp.servers`:
- Start the *documentation-server* using the configured command, which will run:
  ```
  ${workspaceFolder}/venv/Scripts/python.exe ${workspaceFolder}/mcp_server.py ${workspaceFolder}
  ```
  with the workspace directory as the current working directory.  
- This can facilitate previewing or generating documentation locally.

---

## Summary

The `.vscode/settings.json` file is foundational for ensuring a consistent, portable Python development experience, tightly bound to this project's virtual environment. It also provides configuration to easily start a custom documentation server, improving developer productivity and onboarding.
