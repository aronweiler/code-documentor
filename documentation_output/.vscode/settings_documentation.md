# Documentation for .vscode\settings.json

# .vscode/settings.json

## Purpose

This file customizes Visual Studio Code (VS Code) settings for the workspace. It configures Python interpreter paths and defines a custom "documentation-server" entry, likely used to run a server (e.g., for documentation preview or development).

## Functionality

### Python Interpreter Paths

- **`python.pythonPath`**:  
  Sets the path to the Python interpreter used by VS Code in the workspace. This is set to `${workspaceFolder}/venv/Scripts/python.exe`, ensuring all Python-related tasks use the virtual environment's Python executable.

- **`python.defaultInterpreterPath`**:  
  Specifies the default Python interpreter path (same as above), assisting in consistency across VS Code features like linting, debugging, and running Python files.

### MCP Servers (Custom Tasks/Extensions)

- **`mcp.servers`**:  
  Contains definitions for managed servers (possibly provided by a VS Code extension) that can be controlled from within VS Code.

    - **`documentation-server`**:
        - **`command`**: Launches the virtual environment's Python executable.
        - **`args`**: Passes arguments to the Python executable:
            1. Runs the script `mcp_server.py` located at the project root.
            2. Supplies the workspace folder path as an argument.
        - **`cwd`**: Sets the current working directory for the command to the workspace root.

## Key Components

- **Python Interpreter Configuration** (`python.pythonPath`, `python.defaultInterpreterPath`):  
  Ensures Python code run in VS Code uses the project's virtual environment.

- **Custom Server Configuration** (`mcp.servers`):  
  Defines how to launch a documentation server via the MCP (Managed Code Process) extension or similar.

    - **`documentation-server`**:  
      Specifies the command, arguments, and working directory required to start the documentation server.

## Dependencies

### Required for this file

- **VS Code**:  
  Reads this settings file to apply workspace-specific settings.
- **Python Extension for VS Code**:  
  Utilizes the Python interpreter settings to activate linting, IntelliSense, testing, etc.
- **MCP Server Extension (or similar custom extension)**:  
  Interprets the `mcp.servers` block to provide integrated server management.

### Consumed by Other Files

- **mcp_server.py**:  
  The script referenced in the server configuration is launched by the settings here.

## Usage Examples

### Activating the Python Environment

When this workspace is opened in VS Code, any Python operation (run, debug, test) will use the specified virtual environment (`venv/Scripts/python.exe`).

### Running the Documentation Server

If using an extension that supports the `mcp.servers` key:
- Run or control the `documentation-server` from VS Code's command palette, extension UI, or terminal integrations as per extension documentation.
- The server will execute the command as defined:
    ```bash
    <workspaceFolder>/venv/Scripts/python.exe <workspaceFolder>/mcp_server.py <workspaceFolder>
    ```
  with the working directory set to the project root.

---

**Note:**  
If you do not have the MCP server extension or equivalent custom extension installed, the `mcp.servers` section will have no effect. The Python settings, however, will always affect how VS Code interacts with Python code in this workspace.
