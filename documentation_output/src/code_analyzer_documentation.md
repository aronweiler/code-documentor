# Code Analyzer Documentation

## Purpose

The `code_analyzer.py` file is designed to analyze code repositories, extract relevant code files, and provide insights into the file structure for documentation purposes. It is a part of a larger system that likely involves generating documentation for codebases.

## Functionality

### `CodeAnalyzer` Class

The `CodeAnalyzer` class is the primary component of this file. It is responsible for scanning a code repository, identifying files that should be documented, reading their contents, and analyzing the overall structure of the codebase.

#### Initialization

- **`__init__(self, config: PipelineConfig)`**: Initializes the `CodeAnalyzer` with a configuration object of type `PipelineConfig`. This configuration dictates how files are processed, including supported file extensions and patterns to exclude.

#### Main Methods

- **`scan_repository(self, repo_path: Path) -> List[CodeFile]`**: Scans the specified repository path and returns a list of `CodeFile` objects representing the files to be documented. It filters files based on supported extensions and exclusion patterns defined in the configuration.

- **`_should_include_file(self, file_path: Path, supported_extensions: List[str], exclude_patterns: List[str]) -> bool`**: Determines whether a file should be included in the documentation process. It checks the file's extension, exclusion patterns, and ensures the file is not empty.

- **`_read_code_file(self, file_path: Path) -> str`**: Reads the content of a code file using various encodings to handle different text formats. If all standard encodings fail, it attempts to read the file in binary mode with UTF-8 decoding and error handling.

- **`analyze_file_structure(self, code_files: List[CodeFile]) -> dict`**: Analyzes the structure of the provided code files. It returns a dictionary containing the total number of files, a breakdown by file extension and directory, and a list of the largest files by content size.

## Key Components

- **Classes**:
  - `CodeAnalyzer`: Main class for analyzing code repositories.

- **Functions**:
  - `scan_repository`
  - `_should_include_file`
  - `_read_code_file`
  - `analyze_file_structure`

- **Variables**:
  - `config`: Holds the configuration for file processing.
  - `supported_extensions`: List of file extensions to include.
  - `exclude_patterns`: Patterns to exclude files from processing.

## Dependencies

- **Internal**:
  - `CodeFile`: A model representing a code file, imported from `.models`.
  - `PipelineConfig`: A configuration model for the pipeline, imported from `.models`.

- **External**:
  - `os`: Used for operating system dependent functionality.
  - `Path` from `pathlib`: Used for filesystem path manipulations.
  - `List` from `typing`: Used for type hinting.

## Usage Examples

```python
from pathlib import Path
from .models import PipelineConfig

# Example configuration
config = PipelineConfig(file_processing={
    "supported_extensions": [".py", ".md"],
    "exclude_patterns": ["test", "docs"]
})

# Initialize the analyzer with the configuration
analyzer = CodeAnalyzer(config)

# Scan a repository
repo_path = Path("/path/to/repository")
code_files = analyzer.scan_repository(repo_path)

# Analyze the file structure
structure = analyzer.analyze_file_structure(code_files)

# Output the analysis
print(structure)
```

This example demonstrates initializing the `CodeAnalyzer` with a configuration, scanning a repository for code files, and analyzing the file structure to gain insights into the codebase.
