# Documentation for src/prompts/summarize_docs_system_message.py

# File: `src/prompts/summarize_docs_system_message.py`

## Purpose

This file defines a system message prompt template specifically for instructing an AI assistant to summarize chunks of technical documentation. The aim is to ensure that summaries retain crucial technical nuances, architectural decisions, implementation details, and dependency relationships. This prompt is primarily intended for use in larger systems involving programmatic documentation summarization using AI language models (such as OpenAI's GPT).

---

## Functionality

### Main Component

#### `SUMMARIZE_DOCS_SYSTEM_MESSAGE`

- **Type:** `str`
- **Description:**  
  This constant contains a template string to be used as a "system" message when interacting with LLM-based agents. The message instructs the AI to act as a technical documentation summarizer and clearly lays out the requirements for how the incoming documentation chunk should be summarized. The requirements focus on:
  1. Preserving key technical concepts and terminology.
  2. Capturing architectural decisions.
  3. Including critical implementation details.
  4. Noting dependencies and relationships.
  The summary should be both concise and comprehensive.

---

## Key Components

- **Constant:** `SUMMARIZE_DOCS_SYSTEM_MESSAGE`
  - The only exported element from this file.
  - It is intended to be injected into AI system prompts to guide behavior during documentation summarization tasks.

---

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- This file does **not** import or depend on any other local modules or external libraries.

### External Dependencies

- Systems that utilize LLMs (Large Language Models), such as applications built with OpenAI's `openai` Python package or similar frameworks, may import and use this constant as part of their prompt design.

### What Depends on It

- This file will be imported by other modules or scripts that construct prompts for documentation-summarizing LLM workflows.

## Usage Examples

Here's how this file and its system message constant would typically be used in an AI-powered documentation tool:

```python
from src.prompts.summarize_docs_system_message import SUMMARIZE_DOCS_SYSTEM_MESSAGE

def get_summary(document_chunk, llm_client):
    # Prepare messages for the LLM (e.g., OpenAI Chat API)
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": SUMMARIZE_DOCS_SYSTEM_MESSAGE
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": document_chunk
        }
    ]
    # Call the language model API
    response = llm_client.chat_completion(messages=messages)
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

# Usage
chunk = """Your technical documentation chunk here."""
summary = get_summary(chunk, llm_client=some_ai_client)
print(summary)
```

---

## Summary

- **Defines a specialized, reusable system prompt for AI documentation summarization.**
- **Encourages retention of key technical and structural elements during summarization.**
- **Intended for integration with LLM-based systems or scripts needing consistent, high-quality doc summaries.**
