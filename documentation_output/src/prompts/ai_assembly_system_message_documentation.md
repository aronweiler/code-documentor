# ai_assembly_system_message.py

## Purpose

This module defines a system prompt used for guiding an AI agent during the assembly of a document from multiple sections. The prompt instructs the AI on how to combine these sections into a coherent, well-structured, and stylistically consistent final document. This is typically used in applications where AI is tasked with producing comprehensive documents from smaller, individually-generated parts.

## Functionality

The main functionality provided by this file is the declaration of a formatted system prompt template, `AI_ASSEMBLY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE`. This template outlines specific instructions for the AI agent:

1. **Create a coherent document title and introduction.**
2. **Ensure smooth transitions between sections.**
3. **Add necessary connecting text.**
4. **Maintain consistency in tone and style.**
5. **Add a conclusion if appropriate.**

The prompt emphasizes producing a unified and polished document, as opposed to simply merging unrelated text blocks.

## Key Components

- **AI_ASSEMBLY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE (str):**  
  A multi-line formatted string containing the instructional prompt. The `{document_name}` placeholder allows insertion of a dynamic document name at runtime.

Example:
```python
AI_ASSEMBLY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE.format(document_name="User Guide")
```

## Dependencies

- **None**:  
  This file is self-contained and has no code-level dependencies on other modules or packages.

- **What Depends on It:**  
  This module is expected to be imported by higher-level components of the system responsible for automated document assembly, particularly those that interface with AI models for document generation.

## Usage Examples

Hereâ€™s how this module might be used in a larger system:

```python
from src.prompts.ai_assembly_system_message import AI_ASSEMBLY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE

# Specify the type of document being assembled.
document_name = "Technical Manual"
system_message = AI_ASSEMBLY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE.format(document_name=document_name)

# Use 'system_message' as a system prompt for an AI completion/generation model.
response = call_ai_model(
    system_prompt=system_message, 
    user_input=section_texts
)
```

## Summary

`ai_assembly_system_message.py` serves as a centralized definition for a system prompt tailored to guide AI agents in compiling multiple sections into a unified, well-structured document. It plays a foundational role in any workflow where the AI is tasked with high-level document synthesis from modular content.
