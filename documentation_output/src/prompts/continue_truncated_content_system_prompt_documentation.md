# Documentation for `continue_truncated_content_system_prompt.py`

## Purpose
The purpose of this file is to define a system prompt template used for continuing a truncated section of a documentation file. This template is specifically designed to assist in the automatic generation or completion of documentation sections that have been left incomplete. It provides a structured format for integrating existing context and instructions to ensure continuity and coherence in the documentation process.

## Functionality
The file contains a single string constant, `CONTINUE_TRUNCATED_CONTENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, which serves as a template for generating prompts that guide the continuation of documentation sections. This template is intended to be used in systems that automate or assist in writing documentation, particularly when a section has been started but not finished.

### Template Explanation
- **Placeholders**: The template includes several placeholders that need to be filled with specific information:
  - `{document_name}`: The name of the document being completed.
  - `{section_name}`: The name of the section that needs continuation.
  - `{context}`: Existing documentation and context from previous sections to provide background and ensure consistency.
  - `{section_template}`: Instructions or a template for the section that needs to be completed.
  - `{continuation_prompt}`: A prompt or instruction to guide the continuation of the section.

- **File Reading Tools**: The template mentions several tools that can be used to gather additional information if needed:
  - `read_file_content(file_path)`: Reads the content of any file in the repository.
  - `list_files_in_directory(directory_path, extensions="", recursive="true")`: Lists files in a directory, with options for filtering by extensions and recursive listing.
  - `find_files_by_pattern(pattern, directory="")`: Finds files matching a specific pattern.
  - `get_file_info(file_path)`: Retrieves information about a file.

These tools are intended to provide the necessary context or data required to complete the documentation section accurately.

## Key Components
- **`CONTINUE_TRUNCATED_CONTENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`**: The main component of this file, which is a string template used for generating prompts to continue writing documentation sections.

## Dependencies
- **Dependencies**: This file does not explicitly import or depend on any external modules or libraries. However, it assumes the existence of certain file reading tools, which are likely defined elsewhere in the project.
- **Dependents**: This file is likely used by other parts of the documentation generation system that require prompts for completing documentation sections.

## Usage Examples
This file is typically used in a system that automates documentation writing. Here is a conceptual example of how it might be used:

```python
# Example usage in a documentation generation system
document_name = "API Guide"
section_name = "Authentication"
context = "Previous sections have covered API endpoints and request formats."
section_template = "Describe the authentication process, including token generation and validation."
continuation_prompt = "Please provide detailed steps for implementing authentication."

# Fill the template with specific details
prompt = CONTINUE_TRUNCATED_CONTENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.format(
    document_name=document_name,
    section_name=section_name,
    context=context,
    section_template=section_template,
    continuation_prompt=continuation_prompt
)

# The generated prompt can then be used to guide the completion of the documentation section
print(prompt)
```

This example demonstrates how to fill in the placeholders of the template with specific information to generate a prompt that can be used to continue writing a documentation section.
