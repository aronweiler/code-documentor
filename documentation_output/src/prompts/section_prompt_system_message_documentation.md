# Documentation for `section_prompt_system_message.py`

## Purpose

The purpose of this file is to define a system message template used by a technical documentation generator. This template guides the generator in creating a specific section of a design document by providing structured instructions and context. It is designed to facilitate the generation of comprehensive and well-informed documentation by leveraging available tools to explore and understand the project codebase.

## Functionality

The file contains a single string variable, `SECTION_PROMPT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE`, which serves as a template for generating documentation sections. This template includes placeholders for dynamic content and instructions for using various file exploration tools to gather necessary information about the project.

### Detailed Explanation

- **`SECTION_PROMPT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE`**: This is a multi-line string that acts as a template for generating sections of a design document. It includes placeholders for:
  - `document_name`: The name of the document being generated.
  - `section_name`: The specific section of the document being created.
  - `context`: Existing documentation and previous sections' context to ensure continuity and relevance.
  - `section_template`: Specific instructions for what the section should contain.

The template emphasizes the importance of using file reading tools to gather comprehensive information about the project before writing the documentation. It lists available tools that can be used to explore the repository and gather necessary data.

## Key Components

- **String Template**: The `SECTION_PROMPT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE` is a critical component that guides the documentation generation process.
- **Placeholders**: The template includes placeholders for dynamic content insertion, ensuring that the generated documentation is specific and relevant to the project context.
- **Tool Instructions**: The template provides instructions on using specific tools to explore the codebase, which is crucial for generating accurate and detailed documentation.

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- The file does not explicitly import or depend on other modules within the codebase. However, it assumes the existence of certain tools for file exploration, which are likely defined elsewhere in the project.

### External Dependencies

- There are no external libraries or modules directly imported or used in this file.

### Dependent Components

- This file is likely used by a larger documentation generation system that utilizes the `SECTION_PROMPT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE` template to automate the creation of design document sections.

## Usage Examples

This code is typically used within a documentation generation system. Here is a conceptual example of how it might be used:

```python
# Example usage within a documentation generation system

# Assume we have a function that generates documentation sections
def generate_documentation_section(document_name, section_name, context, section_template):
    # Fill in the template with specific details
    prompt = SECTION_PROMPT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE.format(
        document_name=document_name,
        section_name=section_name,
        context=context,
        section_template=section_template
    )
    
    # Use the prompt to guide the documentation generation process
    # This would involve using the tools mentioned in the prompt to gather information
    # and then writing the section based on the gathered data and instructions

# Example call to the function
generate_documentation_section(
    document_name="Project Design Document",
    section_name="Architecture Overview",
    context="Existing architecture details and design patterns.",
    section_template="Provide a detailed overview of the system architecture, including diagrams and component descriptions."
)
```

In this example, the `generate_documentation_section` function uses the `SECTION_PROMPT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE` to create a structured prompt for generating a specific section of a design document. The function would then proceed to use the available tools to gather information and generate the documentation accordingly.
