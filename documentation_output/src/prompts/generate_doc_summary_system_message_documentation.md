# Documentation for src/prompts/generate_doc_summary_system_message.py

# File: src/prompts/generate_doc_summary_system_message.py

## Purpose

This file defines a system message prompt specifically designed for use with an AI model tasked with generating concise summaries of technical documentation. Its primary purpose is to instruct the AI on how to summarize a given documentation excerpt, focusing on clarity and relevance.

## Functionality

The file contains a single string constant, `GENERATE_DOC_SUMMARY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE`, which provides detailed instructions to an AI summarizer. The message emphasizes the need for a 2-4 sentence summary that outlines:
- The main purpose or function of the documented code.
- Key components or functionalities it contains.

The instructions guide the AI to ignore formatting or documentation style and focus on the substance of what the code does.

## Key Components

- **GENERATE_DOC_SUMMARY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE**:  
  A multi-line string (triple-quoted) containing explicit summarization instructions for AI systems. It directs the AI to deliver a brief yet informative summary emphasizing utility and key features.

## Dependencies

- **Dependencies of this file**:  
  None. The file is fully self-contained and does not import or rely on any external modules or packages.

- **Files or modules that depend on this file**:  
  This prompt string is intended to be imported and provided to AI systems (such as LLMs) wherever concise documentation summaries are required, for example, in automated documentation tools or summarization pipelines.

## Usage Examples

Hereâ€™s how this code might typically be used in an application:

```python
# Import the prompt string
from src.prompts.generate_doc_summary_system_message import GENERATE_DOC_SUMMARY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE

# Send the prompt to an AI language model as part of a message payload
response = some_ai_client.chat(
    system_message=GENERATE_DOC_SUMMARY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE,
    user_message=documentation_text
)

# response now contains the concise summary generated by the AI
print(response['summary'])
```

This usage pattern is general and may vary depending on the specific integration with AI model APIs.
