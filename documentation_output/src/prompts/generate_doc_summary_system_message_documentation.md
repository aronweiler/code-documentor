# Documentation for src\prompts\generate_doc_summary_system_message.py

# File: src/prompts/generate_doc_summary_system_message.py

## Purpose

This file defines a system prompt template used by an AI agent for generating concise summaries of technical documentation. It is intended to guide an AI model in creating brief, informative overviews that highlight the essential purpose and key features of a codebase or file.

## Functionality

The primary component of this file is the `GENERATE_DOC_SUMMARY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE` constant. This multi-line string prompt instructs an AI summarizer to:
- Compose a 2-4 sentence summary of given documentation.
- Cover the main purpose/function of the described code and its key components.
- Ensure that the summary is concise, focusing on what the code does rather than details of its documentation.

Such a prompt helps standardize the output for summarization tasks, especially within LLM-powered code documentation and search workflows.

## Key Components

- **`GENERATE_DOC_SUMMARY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE`** (str):  
  A predefined instruction template for a technical documentation summarizer role. It sets the expectations for summary content, length, and focus.

## Dependencies

- **Internal/External Dependencies**:  
  This file has no imports and no external dependencies. It acts as a configuration asset (i.e., a constant string) that can be imported elsewhere in the codebase.

- **Dependent Files or Modules**:  
  Other parts of the project (such as AI pipeline components, documentation generation orchestrators, or agent frameworks) may import this prompt to instruct an LLM when summarizing documentation.

## Usage Examples

Here's how this code would typically be used within a project:

```python
from src.prompts.generate_doc_summary_system_message import GENERATE_DOC_SUMMARY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE

# Example usage with an LLM client or agent:
llm_response = llm_client.generate(
    system_message=GENERATE_DOC_SUMMARY_SYSTEM_MESSAGE,
    user_message=documentation_to_summarize
)
summary = llm_response.text
print(summary)
```

This demonstrates pulling in the summary prompt to pass as the system message when directing an LLM to generate documentation summaries.

**Summary:** This file provides a reusable prompt for generating brief, purpose-focused summaries of code documentation, supporting standardized and relevant AI-generated technical overviews.
