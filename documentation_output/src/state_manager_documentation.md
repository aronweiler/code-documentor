# Documentation for src\state_manager.py

# `state_manager.py`

## Purpose

The `state_manager.py` file provides the `StateManager` class, which is responsible for managing and orchestrating the transitions and conditional logic throughout a documentation generation pipeline. It acts as a central policy engine that checks the current pipeline state and configuration to determine which processing steps should be performed next, such as loading existing docs, summarizing, generating new docs, or moving through multiple files and documentation sections.

This logic ensures an organized and efficient flow in pipelines where documentation is generated for source code with optional design or guide documents, especially in scenarios involving incremental work or multiple document types.

---

## Functionality

### Overview

- **State Management**: Determines what pipeline step should occur next based on the current state and configuration.
- **Conditional Checks**: Encapsulates conditional branching (e.g., whether to summarize content, load docs, or generate new ones).
- **Section & Document Iteration**: Handles the logic for iterating through files, sections, and documents, including when to transition between them.

---

## Key Components

### Class: `StateManager`

Handles all state transition decisions in the documentation generation pipeline.

#### Initialization

```python
def __init__(self, config)
```
- **config**: The configuration object for the whole pipeline. Used for any config-dependent logic in state handling.

---

#### Step Decision Functions

Each function typically returns a `str` command or indicator for the next action, to be handled by the main pipeline runner.

- **should_load_existing_docs(state: PipelineState) -> str**  
  Returns `"load_existing"` if only design docs or guides are being generated (not file docs), indicating that pre-existing docs should be loaded. Returns `"continue"` otherwise.

- **should_summarize(state: PipelineState, doc_processor) -> str**  
  Uses the provided `doc_processor` to detect whether summarization of documentation is required. Returns `"summarize"` if so; else `"continue"`.

- **should_generate_files(state: PipelineState) -> str**  
  Returns `"generate"` if file documentation is requested in the pipeline state; otherwise `"skip"`.

- **should_generate_design_docs(state: PipelineState) -> str**  
  Returns `"generate"` if design documentation is requested; otherwise `"skip"`.

- **has_more_files(state: PipelineState) -> str**  
  Checks if more files remain to be processed (by comparing `current_file_index` with total files list). Returns `"continue"` if so; `"finish"` otherwise.

- **has_more_sections(state: PipelineState) -> str**  
  Manages section-level transitions in the current design document:
    - Returns `"continue"` if there are more sections.
    - Returns `"assemble"` if all sections are done but assembly hasn't happened.
    - Returns `"finish"` if everything is processed, including all documents.

- **has_more_documents(state: PipelineState) -> str**  
  Checks if more design documents are left to process. Returns `"continue"` if more exist, otherwise `"finish"`.

---

#### Pass-through/Placeholder Steps

Useful for hooks or future expansion.

- **check_summarization_step(state: PipelineState) -> Dict[str, Any]**  
  A no-op (returns empty dict) for a summarization step.

- **check_file_generation_step(state: PipelineState) -> Dict[str, Any]**  
  A no-op (returns empty dict) for a file generation step.

## Dependencies

### Imports

- `typing.Dict`, `typing.Any`: For type hinting.
- `.models.PipelineState`: Assumes a local module `models.py` with `PipelineState` class, which models the pipeline state and request parameters.

### External Dependencies

- **doc_processor**: Passed externally to `should_summarize()`; must have `.needs_summarization(existing_docs)` method.

### Downstream Consumers

- This file is intended for use by the main documentation pipeline runner, which will repeatedly call `StateManager` methods to determine the next operation at various stages of processing based on the current pipeline state.

---

## Usage Examples

Assuming availability of necessary dependencies (`PipelineState`, `config`, `doc_processor`):

```python
from state_manager import StateManager
from models import PipelineState

# Instantiate with configuration
state_manager = StateManager(config)

# Example pipeline state (populated from elsewhere)
state: PipelineState = ...

# Decision: Should load existing docs?
load_action = state_manager.should_load_existing_docs(state)
if load_action == "load_existing":
    # Load and merge existing documentation
    ...

# Decision: Should summarize docs?
if state_manager.should_summarize(state, doc_processor) == "summarize":
    # Summarize the docs
    ...

# Per-file generation step
if state_manager.should_generate_files(state) == "generate":
    # Generate file-level documentation
    ...

# Per-section step (e.g., in a loop over files and sections)
while state_manager.has_more_files(state) == "continue":
    # Process file...
    while state_manager.has_more_sections(state) == "continue":
        # Process section...
        pass
```

---

## Summary

The `StateManager` is a centralized utility for handling control flow and state transitions in a documentation generation pipeline. Its methods simplify the logic for progressing between and within pipeline phases (file generation, design doc generation, etc.), enabling well-structured orchestration without scattering conditional logic throughout the codebase.
