# Documentation for src/state_manager.py

# `state_manager.py`

## 1. Purpose

The `state_manager.py` file implements the `StateManager` class, which centralizes and encapsulates the logic for managing state transitions and conditional logic within a documentation generation pipeline. It determines the next actions to take based on the current pipeline state, such as whether to load existing documentation, summarize it, generate documentation for source files, or proceed to the next section or document. This modularizes and clarifies the orchestration logic needed to manage complex documentation workflows.

## 2. Functionality

The core purpose of the `StateManager` is to provide decision-making functions that the pipeline can use to decide:

- What parts of the documentation process to run (e.g., summarization, file documentation, design documentation).
- When to transition between different steps or states (e.g., when all files are processed).
- When to perform certain operations (e.g., load or assemble documents).
- To serve as a reliable, single source of truth for all pipeline state transitions.

All the logic in this class is **stateless** with respect to each method's inputs (except for access to the provided `self.config`), so it can be cleanly integrated into a state-driven orchestration pipeline.

## 3. Key Components

### Classes

#### `StateManager`
- **Constructor**
  - `__init__(self, config)`: Stores the configuration object for later use.

- **Pipeline State Logic Methods**
  - `should_load_existing_docs(self, state: PipelineState) -> str`: Decides if the pipeline should load existing documentation, based on the requested documentation types.
  - `should_summarize(self, state: PipelineState, doc_processor) -> str`: Determines if the loaded documentation needs summarization (delegates to `doc_processor`).
  - `should_generate_files(self, state: PipelineState) -> str`: Decides if file-based documentation generation is required.
  - `should_generate_design_docs(self, state: PipelineState) -> str`: Decides if design documentation generation is required.
  - `has_more_files(self, state: PipelineState) -> str`: Checks if there are more source files to be processed.
  - `has_more_sections(self, state: PipelineState) -> str`: Determines if the current design document has more sections to process, and handles document/section finalization.
  - `has_more_documents(self, state: PipelineState) -> str`: Checks if more design documents remain to be processed.

- **Pipeline Step Placeholders**
  - `check_summarization_step(self, state: PipelineState) -> Dict[str, Any]`: A pass-through (placeholder) step related to document summarization, returning an empty dict.
  - `check_file_generation_step(self, state: PipelineState) -> Dict[str, Any]`: A pass-through (placeholder) step for file generation, returning an empty dict.

### Types and Models

- **`PipelineState`**: Imported from `.models`, encapsulates the working state of the documentation pipeline, including user requests, file indices, loaded documents, and design documentation state.

### Parameters and States

- `state`: The current pipeline state, always an instance of `PipelineState`.
- `doc_processor`: A provided doc processor object which must have a `needs_summarization` method.

## 4. Dependencies

### Imports

- **Standard Library**
  - `Dict`, `Any`: Typing for type hints.

- **Local Modules**
  - `.models.PipelineState`: Used extensively as the data representation of pipeline state.

### What Depends On This

- This file is likely imported and instantiated as a helper inside a higher-level orchestration module, or a main runner script, responsible for the step-by-step management of documentation generation.

## 5. Usage Examples

```python
from state_manager import StateManager
from models import PipelineState

# Example pipeline state with mockup data
state = PipelineState(request=..., current_file_index=0, code_files=[...], existing_docs=..., design_documentation_state=...)
doc_processor = ...  # an object with a needs_summarization method

manager = StateManager(config={...})

# Decision: Should we load existing docs?
action = manager.should_load_existing_docs(state)
if action == "load_existing":
    # Load docs from storage
    ...

# Decision: Should summarize the docs?
if manager.should_summarize(state, doc_processor) == "summarize":
    # Run summarization logic
    ...

# Decision: Should we generate file docs?
if manager.should_generate_files(state) == "generate":
    # Run file generation steps
    ...

# Control flow for sections and documents
while manager.has_more_files(state) == "continue":
    # process next file
    state.current_file_index += 1

while manager.has_more_sections(state) == "continue":
    # process next section
    state.design_documentation_state.current_section_index += 1
```

**Note:**  
Precise details about the `PipelineState`, design document structure, and associated request objects are abstracted, as they are defined elsewhere in the project (`.models`). The `StateManager` expects these structures to have certain attributes, like `request.file_docs`, `request.guide`, `existing_docs`, etc.
