# Documentation for src\pipeline.py

# `pipeline.py`

## Purpose

The `pipeline.py` file implements the main orchestrator for an automated, LLM-powered documentation pipeline for software repositories. Its primary goal is to coordinate the process of:
- Scanning a codebase,
- Gathering and summarizing documentation,
- Generating new documentation for individual files,
- Producing higher-level artifact guides, and
- Optionally, assembling design documents and summary reports.

This file defines the modular LangGraph-based pipeline, manages state transitions, and delegates actual work to specialized helper components.

---

## Functionality

### Core Class: `DocumentationPipeline`

This class encapsulates the entire documentation workflow, handling instantiation, configuration, workflow definition, state transitions, and high-level orchestration.

#### Initialization
- Loads configuration (`ConfigManager`)
- Instantiates logical managers for document processing, code file analysis, LLM invocation, file I/O, reporting, context enhancement, state tracking, and generation of specialized documents (guides, designs).
- Sets up logging for monitoring progress and errors.

#### Pipeline Definition
- The `create_pipeline()` method builds a stateful LangGraph pipeline (`StateGraph`), specifying:
  - Nodes (pipeline steps such as scanning, summarizing, generating, saving)
  - Conditional transitions (based on runtime state and results)
  - Handling for various step outcomes (continue, skip, finish, etc.)
  - Support for incremental, partial, or full documentation regeneration

#### Step Delegation
Each meaningful pipeline step is implemented as a method (e.g., `generate_documentation`, `generate_design_documentation`, `scan_repository`, etc.), all taking the current `PipelineState` and returning state-delta dictionaries for the pipeline state machine.

#### Decision Handling
Pipeline routing and transitions depend on the state and are directed by decision/check methods, most of which delegate to a `StateManager`.

#### End-to-End Invocation
- The `run()` method allows batch setup and execution of the entire pipeline, given paths and options passed in by the caller.

## Key Components

### Primary Classes / Functions

- **`DocumentationPipeline`**: Main orchestrator handling lifecycle, state, pipeline definition, and high-level process steps.
- **`create_pipeline()`**: Defines the state graph workflow and its conditional transitions.
- **Pipeline step methods** (e.g., `generate_documentation`, `scan_repository`): Execute the core work or delegate to a manager/subsystem.
- **Decision/check methods** (`should_generate_files`, `has_more_files`, etc.): Route the workflow dynamically.

### Key Variables/Dependencies

- **`ConfigManager`**: Loads YAML config and exposes model/runtime settings.
- **`DocumentProcessor`**: Handles reading/parsing/writing documentation artifacts.
- **`CodeAnalyzer`**: Scans source files in the repository and identifies targets for documentation.
- **`LLMManager`**: Handles connection to the large language model (e.g., OpenAI, LLAMA, etc.).
- **`GuideGenerator`, `DesignDocumentGenerator`, `FileProcessor`, `ReportGenerator`, `ContextManager`, `StateManager`**: Specialized managers for orchestrating their respective responsibilities.

### Data Models

- **`PipelineState`**: State of the whole process (files, indices, results, etc.)
- **`DocumentationContext`**: Tracks documentation contents, summaries, and original source info.
- **`DocumentationResult`, `CodeFile`, `DocumentationRequest`**: Represent intermediate and final documentation outputs and request settings.

## Dependencies

### External
- `langgraph`: For building state machine workflows.
- `langchain_core` components: For LLM integration and message handling.
- `logging`, `pathlib`, `datetime`, `typing`: Standard Python libaries.

### Internal (Local Project)
- `.prompts.generate_file_documentation_system_message`: String constant for the doc gen system prompt.
- `.guide_generator`, `.design_document_generator`, `.file_processor`, `.report_generator`, `.context_manager`, `.state_manager`, `.llm_manager`: Managers for domain tasks.
- `.models`: Shared dataclasses/models for pipeline state and documentation artifacts.
- `.config`: Configuration loading.
- `.document_processor`, `.code_analyzer`: For doc I/O and repo scanning.

### What Depends On It
Other code, such as a CLI wrapper or server endpoint, will instantiate and call `DocumentationPipeline.run()`.

---

## Usage Examples

Here is how the pipeline would typically be used in a CLI tool or external script:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from src.pipeline import DocumentationPipeline

# Specify repository and output locations
repo_path = Path("/path/to/repository")
docs_path = Path("/path/to/old_docs")        # Optional
output_path = Path("/path/to/output_dir")    # Optional

pipeline = DocumentationPipeline(config_path="my_config.yaml")

# Run the pipeline to generate file docs, design docs, and a guide
final_state = pipeline.run(
    repo_path=repo_path,
    docs_path=docs_path,
    output_path=output_path,
    file_docs=True,            # Set according to what artifacts you want
    design_docs=True,
    guide=True,
    force_full_guide=False
)

print("Pipeline completed")
print(f"Status: {final_state}")
```

The pipeline is stateful and supports fine-grained and incremental workflows, conditional branching (skip unchanged files, reuse documentation guides, etc.), and is highly configurable via YAML.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Error Handling**: Extensive try/except blocks log and track errors per file.
- **Incrementality**: Only changed/new files are processed if possible; prior docs are loaded and reused if unchanged.
- **Logging**: Logs progress, errors, and summary to both console and file for monitoring.
- **Extensibility**: Adding new steps or changing workflow order is straightforward due to the state machine design.
- **Separation of Concerns**: All domain and technical work is delegated to focused submodules; this file is only the orchestrator/controller.

---

**In summary**, `pipeline.py` is the command/control/toplevel file that brings together all the modular components in this codebase to perform automated, LLM-driven software documentation generation, with flexible workflow, robust handling, and easy extension.
