# Documentation for `lc_file_tools.py`

## Purpose
The `lc_file_tools.py` file is designed to create a set of tools for performing file operations within a repository. These tools are integrated with the LangChain framework, allowing for efficient file management and manipulation tasks such as reading file contents, listing files, finding files by pattern, and retrieving file information.

## Functionality
The primary function in this file is `create_file_tools`, which generates a list of `Tool` objects. Each tool encapsulates a specific file operation, providing a standardized interface for interacting with files in a repository.

### Main Functions

- **`create_file_tools(repo_path: Path) -> List[Tool]`**: 
  - This function initializes and returns a list of LangChain `Tool` objects, each representing a specific file operation. The tools are designed to work within the context of a given repository path.

#### Internal Wrapper Functions

1. **`read_file_wrapper(file_path: str) -> str`**:
   - Reads the content of a specified file within the repository.
   - Handles exceptions and returns an error message if the file cannot be read.

2. **`list_files_wrapper(directory_path: str, extensions: str = "", recursive: str = "true") -> str`**:
   - Lists files in a specified directory, optionally filtering by file extensions and recursion.
   - Returns a formatted string of file paths or an error message if the operation fails.

3. **`find_files_wrapper(pattern: str, directory: str = "") -> str`**:
   - Finds files matching a specified glob pattern, optionally within a specific directory.
   - Returns a list of matching file paths or an error message if the operation fails.

4. **`get_file_info_wrapper(file_path: str) -> str`**:
   - Retrieves information about a specified file, including its size, extension, and last modified time.
   - Returns a formatted string with file details or an error message if the operation fails.

## Key Components

- **`Tool`**: A class from the LangChain framework used to define a tool with a name, description, and function.
- **Wrapper Functions**: Internal functions that wrap around the core file operations, providing error handling and integration with the LangChain `Tool` interface.

## Dependencies

### Imports
- **`List` and `Path` from `typing` and `pathlib`**: Used for type hinting and file path manipulation.
- **`Tool` from `langchain.tools`**: Utilized to create tool objects for LangChain.
- **File Operations from `..file_tools`**: 
  - `read_file_content`
  - `list_files_in_directory`
  - `find_files_by_pattern`
  - `get_file_info`
  These functions are assumed to be defined in a sibling module and are essential for performing the actual file operations.

## Usage Examples

Here is how you might typically use the `create_file_tools` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from src.tools.lc_tools.lc_file_tools import create_file_tools

# Define the path to the repository
repo_path = Path('/path/to/repository')

# Create file tools
file_tools = create_file_tools(repo_path)

# Example usage of the tools
for tool in file_tools:
    print(f"Tool Name: {tool.name}")
    print(f"Description: {tool.description}")
    # Example of calling a tool function
    if tool.name == "read_file_content":
        result = tool.func('example.txt')
        print(f"Result: {result}")
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize the file tools for a specific repository and use them to perform file operations. Each tool can be accessed by its name and used to execute its corresponding function.
