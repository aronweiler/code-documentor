# config.yaml Documentation

## Purpose

This file serves as the central configuration for an automated documentation pipeline powered by AI. It defines model settings, processing parameters, file handling rules, documentation output formats, template structures for various document types, and behaviors for retrying failed AI generation attempts. It exists to allow users and developers to customize how the documentation system analyzes, processes, and renders documentation across a large, multi-language codebase.

---

## Functionality

The configuration enables and controls the following key functionalities:

- **AI Model Selection and Parameters:** Specifies which large language model (LLM) provider to use, the model name, generation parameters like `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and recursion limits for processing nested documentation or large logical structures.

- **Token Management:** Controls memory and summarization strategies, including chunk sizes for processing large files or contexts, and when to trigger context summarization to stay within model limits.

- **File Processing Rules:** Defines which file extensions are processed (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.yaml`), and which patterns (directories, files, caches) should be excluded from documentation runs.

- **Pipeline Processing Parameters:** Sets global limits for the documentation run, such as the maximum number of files and whether operations should be incremental (saving as files are documented).

- **Output Configuration:** Determines how generated documentation is formatted (e.g., Markdown), whether original code is included, and if documentation should be presented side-by-side with code.

- **Documentation Templates:** Provides templates (with variables and instructions) for various document sections and types:
  - Project-level documents (overview, scope)
  - System architecture (overview, components)
  - Design, user guide, developer guide, API, module, testing, deployment documentation
  - Each template section can be enabled or disabled, and has its own custom instructions, structure, and token limit.
  
- **Retry and Continuation for AI Generation:** Sets how many retries should occur if the AI fails (e.g., due to truncation), and provides prompts for the model to continue output in case of partial generation.

---

## Key Components

- **model:**  
  Configuration for AI model provider, model name, temperature, token limit, and recursion depth.

- **token_limits:**  
  Governs limits on context size and summarization thresholds to manage LLM context window constraints.

- **processing:**  
  Controls high-level file processing behavior (max files, incremental saves).

- **file_processing:**  
  Details which source file types are included, and which are to be excluded (common for dependencies, build outputs, etc.).

- **output:**  
  Formats and options for final documentation output, such as Markdown format, code inclusion, and documentation layout.

- **templates:**  
  The heart of the documentation system: defines the global and per-document-type templates (using placeholders for dynamic values). Hierarchically arranged (project_overview, architecture, user_guide, etc.), each with sections, enabled switches, and Markdown preambles.

- **retry_config:**  
  Sets retry policies for AI operations and supplies a custom prompt to ensure seamless continuation if generation is truncated.

## Dependencies

### Internal
- **Documentation Pipeline/Application:**  
  The pipeline or application that consumes this config file must be able to:
    - Parse YAML configuration.
    - Interface with the specified LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI).
    - Process and traverse source code file trees.
    - Apply filtering logic (inclusion/exclusion) as specified.
    - Manage output formatting and documentation assembly using the indicated templates and section settings.
    - Handle retry and continuation logic for robust AI output.

### External
- **LLM Providers:**  
  Actual execution depends on access to compatible LLM APIs (OpenAI, etc.), with support for the named models and configuration options.

- **Codebase:**  
  Should be used in conjunction with a source code repository or directory structure; file inclusions and exclusions depend on the intended project layout.

## Usage Examples

### 1. Getting Started with the Pipeline

Most documentation generation tools or custom scripts would load `config.yaml` automatically or with an explicit path. Example (pseudo-code):

```python
import yaml
from documentation_pipeline import DocumentationGenerator

# Load the configuration
with open('config.yaml', 'r') as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Initialize and run documentation generation
docgen = DocumentationGenerator(config)
docgen.run()
```

### 2. Customizing the Output

To generate side-by-side Markdown documentation without original code and for up to 1,000 files:
- Set `output.format` to `"markdown"`
- Set `output.side_by_side` to `true`
- Ensure `output.include_code` is `false`
- Adjust `processing.max_files` as needed

### 3. Enabling/Disabling Documentation Sections

To customize which document types are produced, enable or disable corresponding sections:
- To enable only project overview and user guide:
  ```yaml
  templates:
    project_overview:
      enabled: true
    user_guide:
      enabled: true
    architecture:
      enabled: false
  ```
- Individual sections within each document can also be toggled via `enabled: true/false`.

### 4. Handling Large Files

If your repo contains large files or codebases, adjust:
```yaml
token_limits:
  max_context_tokens: 60000
  summarization_threshold: 60000
  chunk_size: 12000
```
and ensure the running environment and LLM support those limits.

### 5. Retry on AI Truncation

If a model call is truncated, the pipeline will use the `retry_config.continuation_prompt` to prompt the LLM to continue, ensuring seamless multi-part generation.

---

**Note**: This config is foundational—edit it to fit your team’s size, codebase, AI provider, and workflow. Most docgen tools will reload or watch the file for changes. Review provider and model options and keep model limits in mind to avoid failed or partial generations.
